The Makefile has the following targets:

- all - builds the program (default),
- debug - builds the program with no optimizations and with debug info,
- clean - removes the built program and object files created by the building process,
- format - formats all .c and .h files using a .clang-format file.

## How to run

To see the program usage text, run `./sorting` after building it.

TO-DO: List CLI arguments for testing the sorts.
